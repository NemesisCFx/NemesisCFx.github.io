# Cameron Fox - Game Programmer


## About Me
Hi! I'm Cameron Fox, a recent graduate with a massive passion for gameplay programming, game systems, and video games in general. I enjoy crafting player experiences - from responsive controls and interactive systems like hiding or barricading to mini-games, puzzles, and other events in between.
During my final University project, I stepped up to lead a small team of AI programmers, taking over leadership mid-project to ensure the game met deadlines and quality standards, and was rewarded with an outstanding work certificate for my efforts. I am a problem solver by nature, fascinated by
all kinds of games with a special love for single-player adventure and horror titles. My portfolio showcases both solo and collaborative projects, demonstrating my ability to implement engaging gameplay, work in teams and solo, and deliver complete, polished experiences. I am eager to bring these
skills to studios, indie teams, or QA roles.
